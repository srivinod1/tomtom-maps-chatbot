# TomTom MCP Server V2.0.0 Release Notes

## üöÄ Major Features Added

### Enhanced Route Monitoring Tool
- **Natural Language Route Descriptions**: Users can now ask "Show me the bottlenecks on the Barcelona airport to smart city event route" instead of just using route IDs
- **Street Name Resolution**: Bottleneck segments now display exact street names via reverse geocoding
- **Dual API Key Support**: Separate API key support for Route Monitoring API with proper fallback
- **Real-time Traffic Integration**: Directions API now uses real-time traffic data with `routeType: fast` and `departAt: now`

### Improved Location Intelligence
- **Enhanced Geobias Precision**: Search results now use precise address extraction from queries instead of generic city centers
- **Address Extraction**: Automatically extracts specific addresses from queries (e.g., "15 rue des Halles, Paris" from "greek restaurants near 15 rue des Halles")
- **Geographic Intelligence**: Better understanding of location context and proximity-based searches

## üîß Technical Improvements

### MCP Protocol Compliance
- **Fixed Notification Handling**: Properly handles `notifications/initialized` to prevent Railway container crashes
- **Enhanced Error Handling**: Robust error handling for all MCP methods and tool executions
- **Stable Connection Management**: Improved connection stability for Le Chat integration

### API Enhancements
- **Real-time Traffic Parameters**: Added `routeType: 'fast'` and `departAt: 'now'` for live traffic routing
- **Route Monitoring API Integration**: Full integration with TomTom Route Monitoring API
- **Street Name Lookup**: Reverse geocoding for traffic bottleneck locations
- **Natural Language Processing**: Keyword extraction and matching for route descriptions

## üìä Route Monitoring Features

### Comprehensive Traffic Analysis
- **Overall Route Statistics**: Distance, travel time, delays, traffic levels, and confidence
- **Bottleneck Analysis**: Top 3 bottleneck segments with speed reductions and locations
- **Street-level Precision**: Exact street names for traffic incidents
- **Real-time Updates**: Live traffic conditions and delay calculations

### Natural Language Support
- **Route Description Matching**: Understands queries like "Barcelona airport to smart city event route"
- **Keyword Extraction**: Intelligent keyword matching against known route names
- **Flexible Input**: Supports both route IDs and natural language descriptions

## üéØ Production Ready Features
