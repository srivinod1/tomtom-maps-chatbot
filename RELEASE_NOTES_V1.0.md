# Release Notes - V1.0.0
**Enhanced Context Management & Conversational Intelligence**

*Released: December 28, 2024*

## 🎉 Major Milestone

This release represents a significant milestone in conversational AI for location-based services. V1.0 introduces advanced context management, intelligent pronoun resolution, and enhanced conversational flow that dramatically improves the user experience.

## 🚀 Key Features

### 🧠 Enhanced Context Management
- **Conversational Memory**: Maintains context across multiple conversation turns
- **Pronoun Resolution**: Intelligently resolves "they", "them", "the same" references to previous search results
- **Search Type Tracking**: Remembers last search type (restaurants, coffee shops, hotels, etc.)
- **Geographic Intelligence**: Smart city recognition (Paris Central → Paris, France, not Maine, USA)

### 🎯 Advanced Intent Classification
- **Statistical vs Location Queries**: Properly routes "how many restaurants in Amsterdam" to General AI instead of Maps Agent
- **Context-Aware Routing**: Uses conversation history for better intent understanding
- **Geographic Bias System**: Accurate city coordinate mapping for international searches

### 🔧 Technical Improvements
- **Enhanced LLM Prompts**: Better conversational reference understanding with detailed context analysis
- **Comprehensive Context Storage**: Added lastSearchType, lastSearchResults, lastSearchPlaceNames
- **Improved Error Handling**: Better fallback mechanisms and user feedback
- **Geographic Intelligence Function**: Smart city coordinate mapping for major international cities

## 📊 Test Results

- **100% Success Rate**: All 10 comprehensive test scenarios passing
- **Context Management**: Pronoun resolution working correctly
- **Geographic Intelligence**: International city searches working properly
- **Intent Classification**: Statistical questions correctly routed to General AI

## 🔄 Example Improvements
